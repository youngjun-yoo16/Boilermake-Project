# 4Cast Chrome Extension :sunny:

### This is a weather extension that you can use to find weather info about a location you enter (*and find places nearby to check out!*).

## How to use this extension :partly_sunny:

### You'll first want to download all the code from this github repository, then open up "Manage extensions" in Chrome. 
### Since you should have downloaded a zip file, you can open it up into a folder. 
### Then, back on Chrome, click "load unpacked" and select that folder. Now the extension should be visible after clicking the puzzle piece icon in the top right.
